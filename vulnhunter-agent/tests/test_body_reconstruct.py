"""Tests for ``agent/_body_reconstruct.py``.

GitHub's GraphQL ``UserContentEdit.diff`` field doesn't return a
unified diff — it returns the **body snapshot at that edit's
after-state** (plain text). Reconstruction is therefore a simple
"return the oldest snapshot" operation rather than the unidiff-
based reverse-apply chain the design originally specified.

These tests cover the actual semantics:

- Zero edits → current body unchanged.
- One edit → that edit's ``diff`` IS the recovered body.
- Multiple edits → oldest by ``editedAt`` wins.
- Edits supplied newest-first (matches GitHub's GraphQL ordering)
  must still recover the oldest by timestamp.
- Missing ``editedAt`` / missing ``diff`` / non-string ``diff``
  raise ``DiffApplyError`` so the caller aborts the run cleanly.
- The empirical erase-the-body scenario the design was originally
  built to handle (now trivial: the oldest snapshot has the
  markers).
