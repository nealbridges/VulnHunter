"""Security test: VULN-002 — inject_token must scope the operator token to
authorized repo paths (confused-deputy guard, CWE-441).

inject_token attaches the operator's scan token to a URL only when the host
matches. That lets an attacker-chosen owner/repo on the same host receive the
token (confused deputy). With allowed_path_prefixes supplied, the token must
attach ONLY when the URL path is under an authorized prefix.
