"""Security test: VULN-008 — verdict posting attribution + skeptical directive.

CWE-290. The verify verdict comment is posted under the agent's GitHub
identity. Attacker-influenced input may steer the verdict by design, so the
defense is: (A) the developer narrative reaching the verify skill is clearly
labeled user-supplied with an evidence-over-claims directive, and (B) the
posted comment attributes its content to the developer-supplied narrative
rather than presenting it as an authoritative agent assertion.
