"""GitHub REST + GraphQL surface used by ``--mode=verify``.

The existing ``agent/issues.py`` covers issue creation and label
ensure. Verify needs orthogonal operations: read one issue, read its
edit history, list comments and events, post a new comment, reopen.
This module owns those calls so ``verify_post.py`` and
``verify_extract.py`` can both depend on it.

Shared with ``issues.py``:

- ``_github_headers(token)`` builds the same Authorization /
  X-GitHub-Api-Version headers (re-implemented privately here to
  keep the modules decoupled — the function is two lines).
- The retry pattern: one retry on 429/5xx with a fixed backoff.

GraphQL endpoint convention: ``<api_base>/graphql`` for github.com,
``<api_base>/graphql`` for GHE (where api_base is the v3 root).
Same Bearer token.
