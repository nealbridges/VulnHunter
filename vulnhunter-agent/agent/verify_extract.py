"""Extract verify-mode inputs from a GitHub issue's content.

Two responsibilities:

1. **Markers.** Pull the three machine markers /vulnhunt embeds in
   every issue it posts (``vulnfix-key``, ``vulnhunt-finding-id``,
   ``vulnhunt-results-dir``) from the issue body. The body passed
   in should be the **reconstructed original** when the issue has
   been edited — see ``agent/_body_reconstruct.py``. We never trust
   markers extracted from a tampered body.

2. **Narrative + comments.md.** Build the per-issue developer
   narrative (close-event comment + post-close comments) and
   assemble the per-run ``comments.md`` file the verify skill
   consumes. The file wraps user-controlled content in fixed
   ``BEGIN/END UNTRUSTED USER CONTENT`` markers per design §9.1
   and optionally appends an R6 agent-annotation block when the
   agent couldn't resolve one or more ``repo_hint`` strings to
   git URLs (§11).

# hostile or accidental occurrence of the literal END marker would
# truncate the untrusted region early and let user content land in
# what the skill treats as the trusted agent-annotation block.
#
# Case-sensitivity note: the substitution is case-sensitive
# (``vulnhunt-fix-verify`` only). This is safe because the skill's
# marker-integrity check in ``phase0_preflight.md`` is documented as
