"""Post verify outcomes back to the source GitHub issues.

Two responsibilities, owned by this module so the orchestrator's
top-level flow stays linear:

1. **Per-verdict state machine** (design §12). For each disposition
   entry, post the verifier's ``issue_comment`` verbatim and reopen
   the issue when the verdict is ``NOT_FIXED`` / ``PARTIAL`` /
   ``INCONCLUSIVE``. ``FIXED`` and ``INVALID_INPUT`` leave the issue
   in its current (closed) state.

2. **Body-tampering archival comment** (design §12.1). When the
   agent detected that the issue body had been edited since
   /vulnhunt originally posted, it reconstructed the original via
   ``_body_reconstruct``. After the verdict comment is posted, this
   module appends a second comment archiving the original body
   under a clarifying header, so audit readers can see exactly
   which body the verifier worked from.

The module deliberately does **not** apply labels — design §12
removed the label palette. The comment is the audit trail; the
issue state is the gross outcome.
