"""Committed-test-naming gate (REQ-GAT-013).

The security test is authored under a transient `verify_VULN_NNN_*` scaffold
name during the RED->GREEN cycle (the prefix keeps it out of the repo's
default test collection while the agent iterates). Before commit it MUST be
promoted to a discoverable, repo-convention name (test_*, *.test.ts, *_test.go,
...) so the repo's own runner collects it and it counts toward coverage.

This gate fails closed if that promotion did not happen: any file added on the
branch whose basename is a `verify_VULN*` or `exploit_VULN*` scaffold is a leak.
A committed `verify_` scaffold is invisible to the project's test runner, so the
fix ships with zero coverage from its own security test.

Usage:
    check-committed-test-naming.py --repo-root <path> [--base <ref>]

Exit codes: 0 = clean, 1 = scaffold leak found, 2 = usage / git error.
