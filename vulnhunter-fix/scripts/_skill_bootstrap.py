"""Sys.path + interpreter bootstrap for the installed skill layout.

When VulnHunter-Fix is installed via ``install.sh``, its runtime
dependencies (``jsonschema``, ``graphifyy``) live in a bundled venv at
``<skill-root>/.venv/``. That venv is created with **Python 3.11** (see
``install.sh``'s ``find_python311``) and its native extensions are
compiled for cpython-3.11 specifically.

If the caller invokes a script with a different Python (e.g., ``python3
scripts/foo.py`` where ``python3`` is 3.13), pure-Python packages would
still resolve but native modules like ``rpds.rpds`` (a transitive
dep of ``jsonschema``) fail with ``ModuleNotFoundError`` because their
``.abi3.so`` was built for cpython-3.11.

To keep the installed skill working regardless of how the user's
``python3`` resolves, this module transparently re-executes the current
script under the bundled venv's Python if it detects a mismatch. In
dev flow (no bundled venv present) it's a no-op.

Side effects:
- On POSIX, ``os.execv`` replaces the process — anything imported before
  this module is discarded. Callers must import this FIRST, before any
  of the deps that trigger the mismatch. On Windows, ``os.execv`` does
  not block (it goes through the CRT's ``_wexecv``/``_wspawnv`` and
  returns control to the caller with the parent's exit status while the
  child runs detached), so a blocking ``subprocess.run`` is used there
  instead and the current process exits with the child's real code.
- Only fires when a Python binary exists inside the bundled venv
  (``.venv/bin/python3`` on POSIX, ``.venv/Scripts/python.exe`` on Windows).
