"""Tests for scripts/worker-preamble-sync-lint.py.

Verifies:
1. Baseline pass on the current repo (SYNC markers are byte-coherent).
2. Simulated drift is caught with a non-zero exit.

Locks in the mechanism peer review 5 recommended: architecturally-
required duplication needs mechanical enforcement, not review discipline.
