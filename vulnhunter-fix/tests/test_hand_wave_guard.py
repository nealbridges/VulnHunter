"""TS-2 — hand-wave guard (REQ-HON-006).

Skeleton test. Verifies the delivery module refuses to ship a PR body
when any residual_vectors entry matches the hand-wave regex.

The regex (case-insensitive) matches these substrings:
    - "future work"
    - "more work needed"
    - "to be done"
    - "tbd"
    - "later"

Under TDD, `render_pr_body_with_residuals` does not yet exist. This test is
deliberately failing until `vulnhunter_fix/delivery.py` grows the honesty
guards (task-16).
