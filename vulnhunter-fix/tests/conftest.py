"""Shared pytest helpers.

Subprocess coverage: tests that invoke the skill's CLI scripts via
``subprocess.run([sys.executable, str(SCRIPT), ...])`` would otherwise
contribute zero coverage. Setting ``COVERAGE_PROCESS_START`` here
causes the auto-installed ``coverage.pth`` hook in the venv to call
``coverage.process_startup()`` in each subprocess, and the
``parallel = true`` setting in pyproject.toml's ``[tool.coverage.run]``
keeps those per-process data files from clobbering the parent run.

Additionally, remediation-rigor tests import ``vulnhunter_fix.delivery``
and ``vulnhunter_fix.graph``. We add the repo root to ``sys.path`` so
the imports resolve during test runs (the package is installed in
editable mode via ``[dev-packages]``, but sys.path is defensive).
